# Rapido

Slow tests suck, and rapido makes them faster so you can make more descriptive tests!  Rapido extends Rspec so that you can have specs that run fast and are also very descriptive.  Use the ex method like it, but instead of creating a new context, it will run in the existing context.

## Installation
